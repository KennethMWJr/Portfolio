            <p>I am a Software Engineer. Strengthening how we are connected to critical aspects of our social environment - the intersections of community, civic engagement, and business is a passion that has helped mold my sense of purpose. On this journey I am set on a path exploring how digital resources can support such connectivity.   </p>
